# MyXOXgame
Tic Tac Toe game is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while preventing your opponent from doing the same. Players take turns placing their marks on an empty cell until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
